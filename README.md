## 🧠 Techniques & Algorithms

### 🔹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Feature cleaning and transformation
- Handling scale differences using `StandardScaler`
- Outlier analysis using boxplots
- Correlation-based feature selection

### 🔹 2. Linear Regression
- Predicts a continuous target variable
- Model evaluation using:
  - **R-squared (R²)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Interpretation of regression coefficients

### 🔹 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Distance-based classification
- Feature scaling for accurate distance computation
- Performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Comparison of different K values
